      Why did I choose UIU?<br>
      <p>I have chosen  UIU . Because it is a very good private university in Bangladesh. In QS Asia University Ranking 2019, UIU has been
      ranked among the top 350universities in Asia. So it was a good opportunity for me to get a good university for study.The university 
      provides several scholarships to students including the eLINK and cLINK scholarships established with the support of the European 
      Union. For these reasons I love UIU. </p>
